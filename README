Lightweight audio filtering library made from webrtc code.

Build and install using make (`sudo make install`).

My code in here is licenced under the same BSD 3-clause license as the code I took from: https://code.google.com/p/webrtc/

To build the test program (you need openal):
gcc -g3 -Wall -o playback_mic test/playback_mic.c -lopenal -I /usr/include/AL/ *.c agc/*.c ns/*.c aec/*.c other/*.c zam/*.c vad/*.c -lpthread -lm
